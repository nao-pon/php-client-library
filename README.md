php-client-library
==================

A php library for communicating with the copy cloud api

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/copy-app/php-client-library.png)](https://travis-ci.org/copy-app/php-client-library)

This library demos the binary part api, an efficient way to de-dupe and send/receive data with the copy cloud, and the JSONRPC api used by the copy agent, and copy mobile devices, for doing advanced things with copy.

This demo works with the OAUTH api, which you will need to setup at the copy developer portal (https://www.copy.com/developer/).

This example is written in such a way that the CloudApi class itself can be useable as a stand alone object in your project. It is MIT licensed, so feel free to use it anyway you see fit.
